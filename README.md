# WiFi Connect

This web app provides an interface to configure the network name and password for a WiFi enabled device. To access this web app, the device must be connected to Ethernet. Supports Python 3.5+.

To run,

```
python wifi_connect

It will start a server on port 3210. You can then go to `http://[device-ip]:3210/`.
